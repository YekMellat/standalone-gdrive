## Usage Examples

### Logging System
```go
// Initialize with logging options
options := map[string]string{
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "log_output": "/path/to/logfile.log",
}
driveFs, err := drive.NewFs(ctx, "gdrive", "/", options)

// Access logger functions
fs, ok := driveFs.(*drive.Fs)
if ok {
    fs.LogInfo("Starting operation")
    fs.LogDebug("Detail: %s", detail)
    fs.LogError("Something went wrong: %v", err)
}
```

### Team Drive Support
```go
// List team drives
teamDrives, err := fs.ListTeamDrives(ctx)

// Get specific team drive
teamDrive, err := fs.GetTeamDrive(ctx, "team-drive-id")

// List files in team drive
files, err := fs.ListFilesInTeamDrive(ctx, "folder-id", "team-drive-id", false)
```
